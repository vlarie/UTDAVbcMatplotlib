Of the three drugs compared to the placebo control group in this analysis, Capomulin stands out as the only drug to both minimize metastasis and decrease tumor volume, while increasing survival rate over a 45-day period.  

Infubinol and Ketapril performed similarly to placebo in tumor growth changes, although Infubinol showed a slight decrease in tumor volume compared to placebo.  Interestingly, Ketapril showed a slight increase in tumor volume compared to placebo suggesting that there may be an adverse effect of tumor growth.  However, rates of metastatic spread were similar in Ketapril and placebo.

While Infubinol had decreased metastasis compared to placebo and a slight decrease in tumor volume, survival rates were lower indicating that the dose or drug may be toxic.
